Collude is an app designed to help people plan and be informed of events within their circle. 

Using collude, user can create, edit and one-touch RSVP for events within their networks. Events can be planned with the help of the Foursquare API which allows users to search for venues. Users can access a detail view for each event which features a map zoomed to the selected location, Foursquare location details,  and an attendees list.

 Collude uses Parse to handle back end data and was built using the AFNetworking, BlurryModalSegue, uiColor +uiGradients, and UINavigationBar+Addition libraries.
