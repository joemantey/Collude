GUI:

- Brand Sign Up and Log In Views
	- ~~Hide X on login views~~
	- ~~Remove username and only take email addresses~~ needs to take both i think
- NoMoFoMo
- ~~New Event - What does the magnify glass do?~~ (in Other now)
- Name, Attendees, Date need to show real info, not hardcoded stuffs
- Sign out ?
    -Should we do this hotel California Style? You can log in but you can never log out


Parse:

- ~~Save Locations to Event~~
- ~~Sign Up saves data but does not dismiss view~~
- ~~If user is a manager of event they should also be an attendee~~


Other:

- Tie 4Square API to Locations
- Populate Event Detail View
